 * Bitmap Guidelines as Follows:
 
# Move the anti-alias off
	That is no smoothing.
# Use at the specified size or a multiple
  	

The base size is specified above the "Download" button.
To increase the size, you must use a multiple in order to keep the proportions, for example for 8 px : 16, 24, 32... In that case you will obtain a pixelised appearance.
  	Exception : For the fonts with .fon extension, no need to care of the size, just increase it and that jumps automatically on the right multiple.
But they are not supported by all softwares (Photoshop yes, Flash no).
# Don't modify attributes
  	Left align and scale 100%.
